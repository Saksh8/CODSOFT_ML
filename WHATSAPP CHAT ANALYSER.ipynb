The Senior Sec. recognized the efforts put in by the junior sec. and applauded their achievements.\\nThe discussion then moved on to the celebration of reaching the 5K mark on Instagram. Various ideas were discussed, including the creation of a celebratory post and a reel. It was decided to finalize the concept and execute it in a creative manner.\\nThe Senior Sec. introduced an orientation plan that needs to be carried out in our city. Junior Sec. member will visit their old school and local schools in groups of a minimum of three members. \\nThe Junior Sec. was instructed to be in formal attire, speak in English, and carry their laptops for the orientation sessions.\\nThe next step will be to approach the school principal to seek permission for conducting the orientation. \\nThe junior Sec. was assigned the responsibility of communicating with the principal and obtaining the necessary permissions.\\nThe purpose of the orientation will be to attract delegates for registration. It was suggested that the idea is pitched in such a way that delegates are enticed by various aspects, including food, accommodation, and the rich culture of Varanasi. \\nThe seniors emphasized that bringing in a contingent of 20+ students from a single school would be a significant accomplishment.\\nWhile conducting the orientation sessions, the focus should also be on the publicity aspect. The seniors shared their own experiences and highlighted the importance of maintaining a strong public presence during the orientation process.\\nIn conclusion, it was advised to look after each other and support their teammates. It was emphasized that teamwork is crucial, and each member should be prepared to cover for one another in case of any absence. It was also encouraged to continue working on their assigned tasks, as not all seniors can be present in every vertical all the time.\\n\",\n",
